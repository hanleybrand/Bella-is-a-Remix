# Bella Is A...(remixes collection repo)

## About

This repo is a place to collect and make available any and all remixes, additions, etc. to the most awesome minecraft texture pack of all time, Isabella. 

The folders 1.4.x, 1.5.x and 1.6.x are for the versions of minecraft before and after changes in how texture packs are stored (e.g. 1.6.x is a resourcepack, not a texturepack) 

Most development going forward will probably be for 1.5/6.x, but who knows? 1.4.7 still goes strong with ftb, etc. And I'm not actually doing most of the work, I'm just putting it somewhere, so it's not necessarily up to me where development efforts are focused.

## Installation

For more help installing texture packs, see http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Texture_pack#Installing_a_texture_pack

For all versions, if you want to zip the folder you can, but it's not necessary. 

### Minecraft 1.4.x

Drag/copy/move the folder __Isabella II 1.4.x__ into the ```.minecraft/texturepacks``` folder. 

### Minecraft 1.5.x

Drag/copy/move the folder __Isabella II 1.5.x__ into the ```.minecraft/texturepacks``` folder.

### Minecraft 1.6.x

Drag/copy/move the folder __Isabella II 1.6.x__ into the ```.minecraft/resourcepacks``` folder.

## Contributing/Forking/Doing more/etc.

First of all, go ahead. As bonemouse said in his retirement message:

    I'm leaving Isabella in the hands of the community. I'd love to see someone (or some people) take her to 1.6 and beyond. Anyone wishing to continue my work has my permission to do so.

Second of all, I've collected as many files as may be useful in the folders __Isabella src docs__ and __psd files__. Obviously the psd files are as useful to you as your photoshop skills and familiarity with the way I do things in photoshop (mostly layer compositing things, nothing too advanced I don't think, mostly concerned with being able to mix and match different elements without too much reinvention).

Third of all, please open pull requests or other wise alert me to any new thing I should be seeing. I'll incorporate what I can.
